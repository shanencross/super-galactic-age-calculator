## Description

Learning project made for Epicodus school, to practice Test Driven Development. Application which will calculate the user's age on other planets, given their age in Earth years.

The appplication will output the user's name in:

* Mercury years. (A Mercury year is .24 Earth years.)
* Venus years. (A Venus year is .62 Earth years.)
* Mars years. (A Mars year is 1.88 Earth years.)
* Jupiter years. (A Jupiter year is 11.86 Earth years.)

The user will also provide the average life expectancy for their demographic as input, and the application will output the years they have left to live, in any planet's years. If the user has already surpassed their life expectancy, the application will output the number of years they have lived past their life expectancy.
